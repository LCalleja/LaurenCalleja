      <p>My ideal job is a senior chemical engineering consultant, and I will be working on the specific role of <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/53566515?type=standout#searchRequestToken=f9435107-3d5e-489a-9ef8-b51d8902e0e1;">Senior Chemical Engineer at Alcoa</a>. The position of senior consultant is accompanied with a great deal of responsibility to ensure the standards and efficacy is being maintained within the company regarding technology and growth projects for Alcoaâ€™s refineries globally. This position is accountable for the design, execution and development of technology and growth prospects, this means that the applicant must be multidisciplined.</p>
      <p>The successful candidate would need to be able to not only have a strong ability with their engineering specialisation but have extensive experience managing teams and acting as an overseer for different project divisions. To be a specialist the candidate would need a tertiary qualification in chemical, processing or extractive engineering etc, with extensive experience in alumina refining and a sound level of experience in the maintenance, operation and design of a plant.</P>
      <p>The position is appealing as it is with a global company, is challenging and offers highly varied work. I love to travel and experience new places, things and culture and by being a global company, it means that there is the potential to work overseas. Having challenging work keeps me engaged and excited in my job and the variability ensures that I continue to learn and broaden my experiences. Thus, suiting me better than a general chemical engineer that works in a plant with monotony in their role. </P>
      <p>Currently I am undertaking my Bachelor of Engineering (Honours (Chemical)) and have extensive experience in team management. As part of my studies, I have completed numerous reports and feasibility analysis for the design, operation and maintenance of plants, however, I would need to gain experience in alumina processing. Secondly, I would need to be able to demonstrate and show the evidence of being in an executive position in managing teams and stakeholder engagement. </P>
      <p>To gain these required skills I will apply for a graduate/junior position within the company, or another company that that processes aluminium. By completing graduate positions, engineers are given extra support and structure to ensure they have a sound level of understanding and competency within that field. </P>
      <p>To have evidence of being adept at team engagement I would complete workshops and seminars, creating a log of my activities including day to day occurrences that highlight my ability and display sort after qualities. </P>
