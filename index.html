       <p>My name is Lauren Calleja, and I am a penultimate year chemical engineering student. I wanted to be a Chemical Engineer as I believe that engineering is the bridge between research and innovation and the implementation of these new discoveries into the world. </p>
       <p>During university I have been awarded a coursework scholarship for my academic achievement and participation within the community. In particular I am the secretary of the Student Staff Consultative Committee and have been a member since the start of my degree in 2018. Similarly, I was a part of the Engineers Australia Accreditation Panel in 2019 and since the start of COVID when I moved to my hometown, I joined the AlburyCity Youth Council.</p>
       <p>In conjunction with my volunteering, I have completed a number of extracurricular courses and activities including the Melbourne Global Leaders Experience, the Inspiring Leadership Programme and the Young Endeavour.</p>
       <p>I am a member of the following associations to ensure that I am utilising best practice and aware of the issues facing the engineering community; Engineers Australia, Engineers Without Borders, Professionals Australia, RMIT Association of Chemical Engineering Students and Females in RMIT Engineering.</p>
       <p>In my free time I train for Muay Thai and play hockey. I have played hockey for over a decade now and have represented my home community during my junior years and RMIT for University Nationals. In addition to playing hockey, I was a part of the social committee for RMIT Hockey Club and Vice-Captain in the 2019 National Games.</p>
       <p>In 2020 my team won the Hockey Albury Wodonga Hockey 8s Premiership for the Premier Women’s division; in 2019 both my RMIT UniNationals Team and RMIT Hockey Club competed in the preliminary finals. As part of my previous teams, I have won many awards, including Best and Fairest and Coach’s Award, and premierships.</p>
